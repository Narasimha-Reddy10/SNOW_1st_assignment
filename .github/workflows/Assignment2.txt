Now we can directly query data from s3 through view. What is the disadvantage of using 
this approach ? Can you see partitions being scanned in the backend ?
ANswer:DISADVANTAGE is this view created withput partitions hence it will scan through all the data and will take time to return the results.



Create or replace transient table CUSTOMER_SNOWFLAKE_TABLE
AS
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_TEST limit 10000;

SELECT B.* 
FROM CUSTOMER_SNOWFLAKE_TABLE B
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
CUSTOMER_DATA A
ON
A.C_CUSTOMER_SK = B.C_CUSTOMER_SK;

How many partitions got scanned from snowflake table : zero partitions as we have not created any partitions.

COPY INTO @DEMO_DB.PUBLIC.my_s3_assignment/Customer-joined-data-asgnmnt2/
from(
SELECT B.* 
FROM CUSTOMER_SNOWFLAKE_TABLE B
LEFT OUTER JOIN 
CUSTOMER_DATA A
ON
A.C_CUSTOMER_SK = B.C_CUSTOMER_SK
);


 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES - Advantages are when we are dealing with outside snowflake data, we wont be charged for storage we just need to enable the configuration to read the data from exteranal stage.
 also when we have to perform any specific transformations better to filter or restrict the data instead of processing the full data (considering the computation credits)
 When dealing with huge data we need to implement partitions which will make the application faster.
